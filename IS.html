    <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">Screen Time</h3>
    <p>During this pandemic, schools around the globe have been forced to rapidly transition to some online distance learning. A major consequence of distance learning is the increased exposure to screen time. The overexposure to screens especially for adolescents increases the risk of addiction to screens, attention disorders, development of social skills, and of course contributes to a major lack of sleep due to the constant blue light exposure. I decided to ask the Sacred Heart community how the increased screen time was affecting them and their routines, here were some of the results seen through data visualization: </p>

    <center><h4>Tik Tok</h4></center>
    <p>Tik Tok has become the fastest growing media platform in less than a year, and has gained lots of new users during the COVID-19 outbreak. Tik Tok has become an outlet for teens to feel connected with their friends through sharing videos, Tik Tok's renowned "duetting" feature to create content alongside your friends, and of course, following each other! However, with every social media platform comes the negative impact from Tik Tok. Most teens fond of the popular dancing app have the shared goal of "getting the hype", or having one or more of your videos go viral on the app; yet most of the people who go viral are young, skinny cute girls and boys with flawless complexions. I asked the Sacred Heart student body to share how Tik Tok has impacted them, especially during this extended period of isolation from friends and family: </p>
    <ul>I really like the relatability and candidness of some tiktoks that honestly make me feel seen in all my awkwardness and craziness. On the other hand, I also feel the inevitability of societal beauty standards come through tik tok and I have the need to compare myself to others looks or lives.</ul>
    <ul>Tik Tok has honestly negatively impacted me because of the beauty standards it promotes. Only a certain body type will make it into the for you page. You can clearly see how this influences others through their comments saying 'oh I wish I looked like that' or stuff like that. And honestly certain tik tok creators are popular only for their looks. But at the same time I appreciate how Tik Tok shows other creators who don't really care about appearance and they just do funny content.</ul>
    <ul>Tik Tok is a really interesting app because the platform that it currently serves as, is viewed to be more casual and laid back than Instagram or Snapchat, where you feel like you have to display your best and most perfect self to the world, while on tik tok you aren't supposed to be perfect you're supposed to be relatable. It's an app for normal people.</ul>
    <ul>Ever since quarantine, I've been kind of overwhelmed with the toxic culture surrounding body image on Tik Tok. My For You Page has been filled with workout videos, diet routines, 'what I eat in a day' videos, ways to get a 'flat stomach,'' the "so you think I'm SKINNYYY" trend, and more. It has gotten to the point where I don't even enjoy scrolling through Tik Tok anymore because it makes me feel self-conscious and insecure. Of course, there are people who post about loving their bodies, all bodies being perfect, and that kind of thing - but it's definitely less prevalent. I think this culture is probably a result of everyone being stuck inside of their homes and having the time to really focus on the way they look; I hope that once quarantine ends, we see less of this. It really makes me upset to see people using this app to tear each other down and specifically targeting people's body types.</ul>

        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">Personal Data Analysis and Comparison</h3>
        <p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we have all been in quarantine, and most high school and college students have been transitioning to online classes. Quarantine has forced most of us to change our daily routines significantly, and even in some cases affect our jobs and living situation. I have been fortunate enough to be spending my time in quarantine with my family in Massachusetts, and my life and routines have changed considerably from my home life in Manhattan. Given the gravity of the situation, I wanted to use my Capstone project as an opportunity to see how my mental and physical health were adapting to such a new situation.</p>
        <p>In order to see the impact of social media on my health, I used my fitbit to analyze my data over different test periods: in school with social media, in school without social media, quarantined online school with social media, and quarantined online school without social media.</p>

        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">Summary and Insights</h3>
        <p>Now what does all of this mean? I was able to compare my heartrate (relating my anxiety levels), my activity (relating to my mood and energy levels), and my sleep (relating to my mood and energy levels) in these different environments, in order to see how social media impacts my life and mental health.</p>
        <center>
            <h4>Sleep</h4>
        </center>
        <p>What I learned from comparing my sleep data was that by removing social media (and decreasing my overall screen time) especially before bed, I was able to increase my REM sleep (where you dream), and decrease the amount of times I woke up in the middle of the night from restlessness. By removing social media, I was able to increase the quality of my sleep cycle in order to sleep better and longer, which is crucial for young adults! </p>

        <center>
            <h4>Activity</h4>
        </center>
        <p>The major outcomes for my actvity without social media was that I had more free time during the day to get moving and get excercise. Ultimately, without the weight of social media, I felt more energized and motivated to stay focused during school and get active afterschool.</p>

        <center>
            <h4>Heartrate</h4>
        </center>
        <p>From my heartrate analysis, I was able to see that both my resting and average heartrate decreased, therefore reducing my overall anxiety throughout the day. Now of course with my heartrate there are other factors to consider that affect it, such as stimulants: my ADD medication and caffiene intake. Due to my ADD medication, my average heartrate is higher than the normal person and is often at a steady 120 BPM during the schoolday. As seen above, my heartrate without social media decreased overall with less crazy high highs and low lows throughout the day.</p>

        <center>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        </center>
        <p>Overall, from many different stages of trial and error, I learned that it is incredibly difficult to fully remove yourself from social media, especially as a teenager, as it has become an integral part of our communication with friends and loved ones and networking with the outside world. However, after seeing the pronounced difference in my data with and without social media, I promised myself that every time I feel overwhelmed from social media, I will put my phone down, and a take break from all of it for a while, because separating yourself from it can only make you better.</p>

    <div id="Research" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">Negative Impacts of Social Media</h3>
            <p>I was inspired to start my research on social media's impact on teens for two reasons: the impact social media has had on my life, and the impact social media has had on the world. My mother was of course hesitant to allow me to use social media in middle school, but there wasn't too harsh of a stigma around it at the time. Since I first got social media, its use and the message it sends to adolescents around the world has changed significantly. Over the last few years, the rates of diagnosed mental illnesses amongst teens has skyrocketed, partially due to the increased use of social media. </p>
            <p>Nowadays, kids are starting to use social media at younger and younger ages, and it has proven to stunt their development, increase the possibility of attention disorders, and seriously harm their mental health by contorting their outlook on the world based on who they follow. As a child of the social media era, I can speak to the negative effects. Growing up with social media, I was constantly on my devices and became addicted to screens in general, but I did not realize the impact it had on me at the time. It also allowed me to see what my friends were doing and where, practically at all times, which led me to feel left out when I was clearly not invited to some event that was all over everyone's instagrams. Additionally, I am diagnosed with ADD, however I cannot fully associate my diagnosis with my use of social media, as it runs in my family and I was only exposed to social media starting at age 13. But of course, the biggest negative impact social media has on most people's lives, including my own, is the toll it takes on our mental health. Rates of anxiety and depression have rapidly increased with teens over the past few years, and a major contributor to that is social media. The overwhelming fear of judgement from your followers on what you post and when you post it, the pressure to post a "happy birthday" story for people you may not even be friends with just because you would look like a jerk if you didn't, the painful reminder from "social media influencers" that you only get more likes and followers if you have clear skin, a perfectly skinny body, and a nice smile. These ideals of perfection and body image are all over social media, and make teenagers want to change themselves to fit in and "be liked".</p>
            <p>The crucial thing to remember about social media is that it is what you make of it. It is often forgotten and overlooked by many, but you have the control to change what you see on social media. If there are people you follow who make you feel like you aren't good enough or that you aren't worth it, click unfollow. Follow people who inspire you, who support you, and who remind you that you are worth it, because you are, and you should be reminded of that every single day.</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">Tik Tok: A New Wave of Social Media or A Parent's Worst Nightmare?</h3>
        <p>Tik Tok. The one app that my mother is too paranoid to ever download. Tik Tok has become a "creative" media platform where up and coming musicians can advertise their music, Companies can target ads to innovent teenagers, and where teenagers can become millionaires in less than a year just by dancing in their bedrooms. Over the course of my research, Tik Tok went from an unheard of app that barely anyone used to the fastest growing social media platform in the US. The question most adults and specifically parents of young teens are asking: why? Tik Tok will tell you because it's fun! The kids will tell you "because we want to be like Charli D'Amelio!"" And teenagers will tell you "I don't know. But it's addicting". The real answer is that everyone you ask will have a different answer. Some people only watch tik toks when they're bored or procrastinating homework. Some people try to go viral on the apps "For You Page", or main feed. Some people just follow their friends and do fun dances because why not. If you're like me, the third option is where you fall in the Tik Tok world. But for those in the second category, let's just say that's where it gets complicated.</p>
        <p>The reason kids of tik tok is possibly the same reason tik tok is some parents' worst nightmare: no censorship and very little privacy. Now most children want to be famous when they grow up because frankly, who doesn't? However, companies like Tik Tok are taking children's dreams and making them a reality, but not in a very kid-friendly way. As I said before, most people on Tik Tok make videos with the hopes of going viral; but in order to go viral, your account must be public. When your account is public, your videos can be seen, downloaded, and saved by anyone, anywhere, any age. Of course, parents do not want random people all over the world to see their 11 year old child dancing or cursing or doing whatever they may be doing to get viral. Yet in the child's mind, all of their dreams of being famous are coming true right before their eyes. 
        <p>Aside from the privacy issues, Tik Tok has provided a community for people to bond over shared experiences, find new talents, meet new people, and make new friends. </p>

        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">VSCO vs Instagram</h3>
       <center><h4>Could this be the next step for social media?</h4></center> 
        <p>VSCO, one of the lesser known media platforms is mostly used as a photo editing application for social media's such as Instagram or Facebook. But through my research and feedback from student surveys, it seems that VSCO could very well be the future of social media. The powerful idea behind VSCO is in their lack of classic "social media features" such as follower count, comments, and like or dislike buttons. By removing these social media-esque features, VSCO has become a more community based platform that brings people together through photography and art.</p>

        <h3 style="background-color: ghostwhite">The Purpose of Social Media</h3>
        <center><h4>From a teen perspective</h4></center> 
        <p>In hopes of gaining a better understanding of a teen's perspective on social media, I sent out an anonymous survey to the Sacred Heart Upper School posing the question "What do you think the purpose of social media is, and do you think it fulfills that purpose?" Here are some of their responses:</p>
        <ul>"The purpose of social media is to make yourself feel somewhat better with likes and comments and to see what everyone else is doing. I feel it does fulfill this purpose but it also makes me feel terrible about how I look and where I wasn't invited."</ul>
        <ul>"I think it is meant to keep in contact with people, but it sort of turned into "who has the most perfect life?" which I think is the reason it negatively impacts a lot of people's mental health."</ul>
        <ul>"It's to show who you are, not every aspect of yourself but more your overall personality and attributes. I think some do try to show who they are, but others use social media as a tool to flaunt their success and receive positive commentary so as to boost their ego."</ul>
        <ul>"To connect people and it depends on how you use it and the mental health of the person using it. Social media can certainly make existing mental health issues worse or inspire new ones, but it also has the power to improve mental healthy by making people feel understood - such as tiktoks that find that talk about relatable things or ones that make you laugh. If you are using it to express yourself it can be good."</ul>
        <ul>"I believe the purpose of social media is to spread all kinds of news and I believe it does fulfill this purpose."</ul>
